# Review Landing PAge


## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜Š

Welcome to this front-end coding challenge.

This challenge will help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this review page component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.


Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page


## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized.


The primary fonts in this project is Open Sans and Roboto

1. create a repository on github and name it **review-page**
